dfutils is a utility mod for the Minecraft server [DiamondFire](https://mcdiamondfire.com/home/), improving the coding and playing experience alike.

## Features
- Automation of commands / general features
- Several custom HUDs and GUI improvements such as the ability to pick out codeblocks from your inventory
- Keybinds to make your life easier
- Makes you very cool, women will find you on average 3.7x more attractive (trust me bro)

## Download
The mod **will** be available on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com) later on, which is where it is recommended to get the latest versions.

Due to the lack of features, the mod has not seen an official release yet, when it does, it will also be available on Modrinth.

For now, you can build the mod yourself if you'd like the latest commit's version.

## Contributing
As always, the mod is open source, so you're welcome to make a pull request.

## Special Thanks
[@homchom](https://github.com/homchom) - Developer of the now discontinued [recode](https://github.com/homchom/recode).

[@DFOnline](https://github.com/DFOnline/) - Developer of [CodeClient](https://github.com/DFOnline/CodeClient).

Both of these developers have helped me tremendously both in inspiration and in the way I make mods. Some features I could have never implemented without looking up how they did it.

Recode being discontinued is actually why I made this mod.

(p.s. the mod has features CodeClient has, because I am developing this to only need 1 DF mod forever. Apologies DFOnline. Still, this could never replace CC, because I am not making a 1-1 copy of it.)
